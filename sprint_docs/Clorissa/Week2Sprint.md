 ## Description of Sprint
Created code for the camera using a local version of the app called StalkerTest. Attempted to get the current ersion of the app, StalkerApp, running on my machine.
When running npm installed nothing was happening and the app would not serve. Although code was written for the camera, since it is a native feature a phone was required.
Unable to launch app to phone. Error also occurred when attempting to push test code to my repo.
