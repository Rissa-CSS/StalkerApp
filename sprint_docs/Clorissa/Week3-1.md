## Description of Sprint

Got a local version of messaging app to work with realtime chat system. This could not be implemented
into master branch as yet because the implementation of a friends list is in progress. Also although both
users can chat to each other the messages do not appear in chronological order. The database also needs to be
updated in order to implement this feature into the main app.
