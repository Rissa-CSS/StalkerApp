 ## Description of Sprint
Created a function that checks if it is a user's first time authenticating:if yes, add them to database, otherwise continue.
Split user's name into first and last on Profile Page, and both can be edited. To edit name, user gets prompted with a popup box, where
they either save the change or cancel. When edit is saved, changes are tracked in firebase authentication and in the datatbase.
