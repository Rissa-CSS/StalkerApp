 ## Description of Sprint
Spent more countless hours attempting to get Google login to work on an android device, but finally got it to work; lots of time spent 
messing with version conflicts in platforms/android and Android Studio. Created a developer accout for Facebook and implemented Facebook
authentication. Now, there are logins available for all 3 social media authetication choices. Added user information to Profile page
that allows a user to edit their name. Lastly, added code that when logging into StalkerApp via Google login and the user has not
yet registered an account, their information is added into firebase authentication as well as the database.
