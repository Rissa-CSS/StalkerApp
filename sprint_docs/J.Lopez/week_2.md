 ## Description of Sprint
 Added a Twitter and Google login. Was able to get my hands on an Android device so I could test the buttons with cordova. Twitter works 
fine, but turns out Google does not. Debugged Google for hours trying to get it to work with Android Studio but nothing has worked yet.
Also, I noticed a white screen on the Android device after the splash screen; fixed that in congig.xml.
